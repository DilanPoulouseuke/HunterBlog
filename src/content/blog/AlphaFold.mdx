On 8th May, Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs unveiled the third generation of its protein folding model, AlphaFold3. Which succeeds the previous 2 versions of AlphaFold1 and AlphaFold2 released consecutively in the year 2018 and 2020 respectively.

Before understanding the AlphaFold3 purpose and place in this big innovative web, We need the right questions to start because the right answers require the right questions.

- What are proteins?
- What is Protein folding problem?
- How does Deepmind's AlphaFold work?

## What are proteins?

Proteins are small machines that work inside our body but not just our the body but in every single organism in our whole universe. It is estimated that our body alone contains more than 400,000 proteins, different proteins have different functionalities.

These proteins are essential for our life and perform functions from regulating glucose to building muscles. Proteins work together to perform the programmed functions. And these proteins are the reasons for causing illness in our body.

## What is protein folding? And What is its problem?

Proteins are built with combinations of amino acids, It is the molecular level of what’s inside Proteins and each protein has 20 amino acids. Protein folding is the process of linear chains of amino acids forming a 3-Dimensional structure for the protein to work, it will be in the form of Origami Structure. This is the crucial process as it defines the proper functioning of proteins, and their structure determines their function.

Misfolding of proteins can lead to a lot of nonfunctioning, which are associated with various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
To cure those diseases and many other diseases, scientists tried to find a method to reliably determine a protein’s structure from its sequence of amino acids alone.

## How does Deepmind's AlphaFold work?

In this wide challenge of predicting protein folding structure to cure diseases at the molecular level, AlphaFold is a deep learning based algorithm for accurate protein structure prediction.

However, traditional experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy have been used to determine protein structures, But these methods can be time-consuming, and more importantly difficult to apply to all proteins.

To tackle these huddles let's look at how AlphaFold unveils new discoveries in this protein structure problem through each version right from AlphaFold1 to the recent release of AlphaFold3.

AlphaFold Ai model trains itself on 200+ million entries from public databases, such as UniProt, which have mapped out amino acid chains to protein structures.

### AlphaFold 1

AlphaFold 1 used a combination of machine learning techniques and a physical model of protein folding, Where it estimated the protein structure and mapped the difference rather accurately predicted the structure.

### AlphaFold 2

AlphaFold 2 uses a deep neural network architecture that was specifically designed for protein folding prediction. It is also much faster than the original AlphaFold.

### AlphaFold 3

AlphaFold 3 took a leap towards new discovery as it's an AI model that can predict the 3D structures of various molecules such as all the elements of biological life, not just proteins.

AlphaFold 3 can predict the structures of DNA, RNA, and molecules like ligands, which are essential to drug discovery. And Isomorphic labs (Google’s Drug Discovery lab) uses AlphaFold3 for that specific purpose.

Even the traditional experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are still in place. But with the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence, new discoveries have been finding its way into all domains, improving the traditional methods with less time consuming and making life easier. Let’s wait for what AlphaFold unfolds in our future.
