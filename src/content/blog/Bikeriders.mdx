You can give everything all you got to a thing, it’s still just gonna do what it’s gonna do. No matter how much effort, time, and dedication you put into something, the outcome is not entirely within your control. There is no balance in any nature that the "thing" will ultimately follow its own course, influenced by factors beyond your influence or efforts. This is the point the movie bikeriders tackle.

Based on the book “The Bikeriders” by Danny Lyon, an photographer and writer who traveled with the motorcycle gang called Outlaws (Which was changed to the name Vandals in the movie), documenting their lifestyle and recording their stories about how a fun, collective golden age of motorcycle gang camaraderie turned into a criminal gang.

Main thing I love about this movie is the culture of how a group of outsiders come together to form their
own community group, exploring their love and culture for motorcycles. I was very intrigued by how their
passion and love for bikes drive their lives, turning their fun hangouts into opportunities to take responsibility
for their actions. ![The Bikeriders](src/assets/images/InCollage_20240716_193619477.jpg)

The movie had a lot of good moments and actors made a life out of those characters, Each character is uniquely structured with their own characteristic and accents. The accents and voice for each character are one of the great things about this movie. Especially Jordie Coomer as Kathy and Tom Hardy as Johnny carried this whole movie on their back with extraordinary acting.

The main problem why this movie didn’t work out for me even though it was good at filmmaking and bringing the 60’s life to the screen is because there was not so much to offer on the story part. It follows the creation and downfall of the motorcycle club as in true events but fails to engage with an intriguing storyline. This makes it a normal, fun movie that is only worth watching once.
