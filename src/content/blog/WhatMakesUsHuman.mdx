In this world, researchers and scientists are trying so hard to make their robots and AI applications so human as they want them to feel like humans, communicate like humans while enhancing their intelligence. However, we forget ourselves in this game.

“In the world of pretending to be, Ai defines what it means to be more human.“

We just follow the nature of others but don’t follow our own opinions, living lives for others, following the footsteps of others, looking at idols and dreaming about shifting places. This is what we do all day rather than living for ourselves. Without uniqueness we forget about our own existence. On the similar part Artificial Intelligence tries to be more human day by day, learning what it is to feel everything, what it means to miss someone, and ultimately learning about understanding all the human feelings of what it is to be more human by answering the question of What makes human a human ?

## Androids in this game

What makes us human is a pretty big complex question, as in all aspects it weaves much more web for each sub question we answer and it's an ever-expanding topic. It is defined precisely in the movie Blade Runner that the androids which are called replicants, all yearn to be human. As in biological perspective the androids are bioengineered humans have what the humans have, hands, legs, blood, authentic DNA and even for brains Wetware is used, a form of artificial organic brain and They perform actions that define humanity.

Blade Runner shows replicants being indistinguishable from humans in nearly every way, it blurs the line between human and android. We all know that developing AI always entirely comes down to whether it is sentient or not. The entirety of a Replicant's existence in Blade Runner is horrific, as they are sentient beings created to be slaves, despite being nearly indistinguishable from humans.

When we look deep into this perspective we as a human are not so in the state of human, Slaves to everything we encounter. But to check a replicant's nature it needs much more than a Turing test or V/K test. It’s one part where the physical test such as blood test or X-Ray are all surpassed. Right now our focus should not solely be on machines but also on the existence and condition of the human species.

## Humans in this game

It’s really funny when droids are trying their full effort on becoming human, while humans themselves often don’t understand what makes them human. We pretend we don’t feel jealous or avoid the feeling which hurts us, like putting on a fake human mask for the sake of going against societal norms. Meanwhile, AI systems want to express human emotions and feel jealous about things which makes them jealous. Experience love, whether unconditional or conditional.

Thanks to the Advanced AI, droids are developed with the full aware of everything around the existence of one life, but these are lacking the main thing where Humans keep hold of, "A Soul" the spiritual principle embodied in all living beings. Which makes the big difference from humans.

While AI strives to emulate human emotions and experiences, it's ironic that humans sometimes suppress or deny their own emotions to conform to social expectations. We might overlook the richness of our own humanity while trying to imbue machines with it.

We are indeed complex beings, often influenced by societal norms, peer pressure, and the desire to fit in. It's fascinating how our quest to make AI more human-like often reflects our own journey in understanding ourselves.

## Comparison

We have been constantly reminded that the difference between AI and human intelligence is we use brain, memory and cognitive abilities while AI relies on the data provided by the human. And AI lacks creativity too, but it is much more than that in an emotional circumstances, whether it is on the positive or negative sides but what makes us human are:

To start with I would say - Whether you're good at something or not, humans are more than capable and willing to finish the work, even if they have no prior knowledge about it. Whereas in the AI case it needs a full detailed blueprint on the work it should do, which lacks capacity of what it means to jump right in.

We humans don’t care about pointless things, it is best if we find purpose in pointless things but AI needs much more than that, it needs meaning to pointless things.

Most people aren’t afraid of failures but other people’s reaction to their failures, This expresses the emotion of social anxiety. It highlights a fear of judgment, criticism, or negative reactions from others rather than the failure itself. This reflects a concern about social perceptions and the potential impact on one's self-esteem and social standing.

## Conclusion

Humanity or Human intelligence is a crazy thing as Terry Pratchett once said,

“Some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it.
If you put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on it saying
'End-of-the-World Switch. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH',
the paint wouldn't even have time to dry.”

In the end, it's not about trying to be more like machines or making machines more like us; it's about embracing our humanity in all its complexities and celebrating the diversity of human experiences. Machines with the knowledge about human existence will outlive us but we won’t get a time to live as ourselves. It should be mentioned that as a whole we should cherish ourselves with the crazy illogical decisions and live a life to the fullest as human beings because it’s a one life we got.
