A brilliant and insane movie I have watched in recent days, Right from its incredible cinematography with a wildly vivid and evocative color palette to the Intense and deeply unsettling performance with an Intensely confined sound design, it showcases the best craftsmanship from the director Coralie Fargeat.

I had been putting it off for 3 months and today I finally got around to watching it. At first I planned to watch only the first half and save the rest for later. But I was in for the ride and I ended up watching it in one sitting, and I regretted not watching it sooner.

I was much impressed with the execution of this movie more than the baseline story it is based on. It was the finest film I have watched in recent times. However, I think the theme where this whole movie is based could be upgraded. Since it takes place in Hollywood, Los Angeles, it could have been good if it got delved deeper into the Film industry adding more depth and escalation to the plot.

Some plot holes are clearly noticeable at times and felt a bit too cartoonish, which could have been avoided to create a normal, most realistic, day to day life horror atmosphere but it was already set in a fictional staged narrative which had a huge impact in our society.

The last 15 minutes felt so prolonged to a level as it was much more melodramatic and escalated to the level right from where it was based at first. However the whole coverage of the movie in a limited production setup was very much effective for this feature as it revolves around only 5 to 6 locations throughout the whole movie.

These are the only concerns I had while processing the movie. But what needs to be appreciated should be appreciated. The first is the acting of Demi Moore is vividly astounding, she absolutely deserves a Best Actress nomination for this role, She was furious in the both beautiful and ugliness in her character as together.

On the other hand Margaret’s performance was lacking in some areas as her screen time was not that great compared to Demi Moore who stole the show for me. She was too good for a rising star. She is young, energetic, furious and will be the next Emma Stone in the next few years for sure. I’ve been following her work since HBO’s The Leftovers, and I believe she has plenty of room to shine in Hollywood.

Haunting cinematography combined with striking color palette and sound design and almost obnoxiously captivating sound design, was really well made. At times, the ASMR-like elements added to the film's crazy aesthetic, making it even more immersive., This was the second feature from Director Coralie Fargeat and it is already in the best quality in my opinion and I’ll definitely be following her upcoming movies.

Overall, this is a must watch movie for everyone as it conveys a powerful message, there isn't a better version of you but it’s you the best version of yourself, So stop being too hard on yourself for the lackness and learn to love yourself more.
