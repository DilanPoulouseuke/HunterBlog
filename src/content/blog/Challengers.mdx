There was this book named Lolita which has this very much more of an unpleasant storyline written by the famous Russian author Vladímir Nabokov. When everyone questioned the purpose of this literary novel, he said that he believed through the artistry of language and storytelling, even the most morally repugnant subject matter could be transformed into something beautiful and thought-provoking. As in books what he achieved is done by Luca in movies. And if that’s what he is doing then I am gonna say that it’s working perfectly. Even though it’s not his writings but his unique vision and interpretation add a depth more in a way.

If I were to write about Luca Guadagnino's filmography, I would say that his work is consistently disgusting but brilliant filmmaking. I've been following his works since Call Me by Your Name, and I'm convinced that he is the only director who can pull these strings and earn applause.

Challengers encompass more than one could grasp at first watch. It's perfectly structured with a multitude of emotions, delving into different themes such as obsession, infatuation, passion, friendship, and love in its various forms.

Unlike a typical storyline where tennis serves as a backdrop to relationships, Challengers flip the coin by structuring relationships around the sports which make it more different as the characters are so addicted when it comes to tennis. This inversion can make the narrative feel brutally tiresome, as the intense focus on the sport intertwines with the complexities of human connections. Which makes them do whatever they can to win any form.

Though there is not so much of the story as the movie is already marketed by telling the main concept and story everywhere but what sets it apart and makes it special is the way it is portrayed and the hidden, heart wrenching scenes which makes a profound impact on everyone left speechless that makes so much more uncomfortable but picks up in a pace with anticipation that elevates everyone cheers to what happens next.

Challengers gave me the experience of both the feeling of letting down at one moment and boosting me through the other, which makes me like this movie and think about it all day since I watched the film and yearn to watch it again. Because the feeling which this movie left me with is indescribable, I can't describe what I watched for so long even after the movie ends, it was like a rollercoaster ride with ups and downs but it was a great experience as with a lot of great cinematography, some of which are very much new to cinema. And it keeps its pace as simple and not more of a boring but rather enjoyable movie.

Finally if I have to mention one thing before wrapping this movie is the banger score, those are some of the absolute energetic and electrifying scores which boost the scenes even with normal conversations. The kind of music that will make you wanna run a marathon and win. That's all I could talk about this movie and it's definite a watch for real.
