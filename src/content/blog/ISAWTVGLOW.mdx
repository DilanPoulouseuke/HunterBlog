Lack of will to act when it was the time you should jump, where instead trying to make everything meaningful and finding logic to take each step will end up people living empty lives is what this movie conveys in one part, which most people find it hard to grasp out of this movie.

It is a coming of age surrealism tackled story which involves two teenagers bonded over a tv show called The Pink Opaque, a bizarre tv show with the adventures of fighting with the supernaturals, This takes the leap between the two teenagers when the reality cracks between what's real and what is not.

This is an experimental movie with a new way of horror which most people haven't heard, analog horror with the expressiveness of psychology. This form of horror doesn't involve ghosts or monsters, As many have only been familiar with jumpscare horror but it should be known that there are different types under the banner of horror genre and this is one of them.

This film tackles two points each on their own understanding of the viewer's perspective. Where one point is no matter which way that coin toss goes, it was the right choice to take it, to make the gamble. Better to go out in the worst possible way than to live an empty, hollow, Midlife crisis. And then the second point comes to the understanding and acceptance of Queer identity, as the two main leads suffer from the complexity of being who they are in this society.

Even Though this movie successfully captured the theme and progressive points on screen, it fails in the narration. With the cliche writing intact this movie fails to make a grip for the audience to grasp. Aesthetic vibrant lighting colors makes the visual representation of the character's emotional state really well and the color grading was on the point to make this film the best in making.
