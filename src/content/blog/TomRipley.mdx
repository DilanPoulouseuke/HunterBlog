Tom Ripley is the most ambitious character in the writing era of Patricia Highsmith, He was introduced in the The Talented Mr. Ripley novel in the year 1955. Since then there have been many Film and Show adaptations and with several famous actors portraying the role of Tom.

## Protagonist or Antagonist

Patricia Highsmith introduces Tom Ripley as an orphan raised by his cruel Aunt, Who wants a lavish lifestyle and is willing to do anything--even commit to murder someone to get what he wants.

Tom Ripley is the strangest character I have ever read. Every character has a point in life where they follow a path of events to reach there, but in Tom's life it’s different. Even though he wants a good life, he’s drawn to one filled with thrills, manipulation, impersonation, and imitation—a world he constantly finds himself in.

Con man who impersonates others and snatch their lifestyles and ideals. Live as if nothing changes, At one point, he even says,

	'I always thought it would be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.'
</blockquote>
Which reveals his unique perspective–a protagonist with a different thought process and Antagonist mindset,
casting him as an anti-hero.

## Personality - Psychopath?

Tom exhibits high psychopathic traits but the thing is Tom sometimes acts so emotionally during the killings like a frightened animal caught in a desperate situation. He often finds himself in a situation that will trigger his survival instincts. As I said, Tom’s character is different and despite his psychopathic tendencies, he occasionally shows glimpses of human qualities, such as feelings of guilt. Which is a thing a serial killer or a psychopath does not have in point.

In Ripley's case he feels guilt and that guilt is short lived at that moment too. He is not driven by pure malice but rather by the desire to survive and thrive in the life he covets,which leads him more cunning to achieve his goals. And I would say people with Ripley’s mindset are the people possess greater intelligence and have the ability to escape from any situation

## My perspective on Ripley

When I first read the The Talented Mr. Ripley novel, it had a lot of similarities between the characters I was already familiar with. For example, Joe Goldberg from 'You' have a very similar nature as Tom Ripley has, it is as if the Joe Goldberg is written with the inspiration of Ripley in mind.

Both the characters align with the similar ways when being a con artist, willing to commit murder and get away with their crimes. While Joe is so obsessed with women, Ripley is obsessed with possession and status. And importantly it should be noted that the Ripley character was introduced in 1955 where Joe was introduced in 2013.

If I have to pinpoint Ripley's need and character in one phase it is "A person who has nothing to lose yet stands to lose everything." If Tom doesn’t exhibit survival instinct and acts He could lose everything that isn’t truly his.

## Beyond Ripley as a character

In my childhood I always wanted to be someone other than as I am right now. It's natural that I wasn’t alone in feeling that way, as many people experience the same. But in those times, we were who we are, we are not influenced or driven by anything to follow one path or another. There was no impersonation, rather it was genuine in everything.

But now there are no our own morals or ideals and everything we claim we did for ourselves is influenced by others, we own things we never want or dream about things we never need.

In that context Ripley shows he has no remorse for anything. It’s as if he could just become anyone,
even a fake made up person who has a nice life, friends, real but easily fixable problems, etc. or he
could be a man in midlife who can provide a day to day care and live a life with no personal morals or
ideals-just an existence based on imitation. And with that mindset there is no stopping for people like
Ripley and which places them above the rest of us. ![performance](src/assets/images/Mirror.png)
