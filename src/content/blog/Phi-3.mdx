Recently many companies have been releasing new versions of their model to define their place in the web of Artificial Intelligence. Now in that race Microsoft unveiled their new small model that can look at pictures, called Phi-3-vision.

## What is Phi-3-vision

Phi-3 vision is a 4.3 billion parameter model, can answer questions about images or charts. Itâ€™s a Small Language model and it should be noted that the Small Language Model requires very less computing resources where the LLM requires more.

This Phi-3-vision succeeds the previous publicly available SLM Phi-3 family, which Microsoft announced it in April with the release of three models-Phi-3-mini(3.8 billion parameters), Phi-3-small(7 billion parameters), phi-3-medium(14 billion parameters).

Microsoft has been very much showing interest in developing SLM, as they developed a series of SLM that offers many of the same capabilities which could be found in LLM but on smaller size trained on smaller data.

## Small Language Models

Small Language Models are small Ai models developed in the sense of compactness in mind, don't require much computing resources and designed in the form to work much more feasible on smaller devices like phones and laptops.

Not only that it is trained on small data compared to LLMs, which are trained on large data, but these small data are extremely high quality data rather than raw data which LLMs trained on. The data is constantly kept filtered to achieve the highest data quality, which produces high-quality results in just ease of computing.

With the LLMs, there is a constant need to access the cloud to get things done, but with the SLMs there is no need for that. As it developed in the mind to just eliminate that interaction altogether.

These new model inventions have been rising at a larger phase as it is helping much more for employees and developers to develop the applications around these models easily and it sure is going to be explored in a wide range.
