Spilling hot tea, A new Ai model is in town. OpenAi announced a new flagship model GPT-4o (O for omni) today at their Monday Event. And a big change is it’s free to use, succeeding the previous GPT 4 version, Which is a paid version, this new update will take the place of GPT3.5 version with a catch.

Now this new GPT-4o is expected to make a real time conversation with the user. Ever since the Ai assistance came into existence, we all were expecting the same thing. Will it act like Samantha from Her movie? But year after year it did not happen because there were a lot of constraints, but now with the help of LLMs intact Ai agents became more than what it was capable of back in 2014.

Now in this new flagship version the ChatGPT talks like Samantha, which is pretty attractive and the developers, Staffs and OpenAi CEO Sam Altman are already marketing it around the Her movie.

## What’s New?

It is now not only generating big paragraphs but making a real time voice conversation and acting as the assistance similar to Siri and Alexa but with the capability of solving much more complex problems.

The model can interact with real problems as well, one of the developers in demonstration opened his camera and filmed an algebra problem (3x + 1 = 4) and asked the model to not solve it rather guide him to solve it. For this query the GPT became the teacher and helped him to solve the problem.

The tool now supports more than 50 languages, able to have a conversation in multiple languages by translating and responding automatically.

On the array of new stuff, Now the GPT has the capability to store all the previous conversation and has the potential to revert back and continue where the user left off.

The OpenAi CTO Mira Murati called GPT-4o an “omnimodel.” That means faster responses and smoother transitions between tasks than previous Chat GPT-4.

As of right now the catch is, it is unclear how many conversational limits can be allotted to the free users but it’s said that after a certain number of interactions it will revert back to Chat GPT-3.5. But the paid users can have more useful ways to use this new revolutionary tech.
