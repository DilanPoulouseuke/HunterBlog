To one of the biggest titles I have ever heard, 'The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfareâ€™, Guy Ritchie brings out movies every year. But as of right now, I'm sure he is experimenting with a new different directing style rather than sticking to the same gangster, anti-hero concept that typically wins against all odds.

Now it doesn't even look like a Guy Ritchie movie, except for the part where all the cast are men with rugged faces and one female cast member. Everyone seems to be doing everything that comes to their mind, injecting the scene with energy and offering diverse opinions and viewpoints.

But the gang wins against all the odds, making it more uninteresting. It still hasn't changed, and there is no leverage on the hero's side. Based on true events, backing up the movie to stand still, but still can't believe it's based on a true story. Guy Ritchie hinted at Nazis in his movies beforehand, but this time he jumped right into making a movie solely about killing Nazis, making a similar but lighter Guy Ritchie version of Inglourious Basterds.

The movie normally looks polished, and, so to say, with more dialogues sounds like riddles, conveying in the sense of unfamiliarity. The music was a miss, easily forgettable, with not a lot to remember.

It's not a movie that should be a must watch and if you do watch it, you will definitely forget about it for sure. But Overall it's a fun, adventurous movie if you have nothing to watch with plenty of time to spare.
