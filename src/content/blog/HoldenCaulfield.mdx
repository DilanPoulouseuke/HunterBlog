## The Protagonist

Holden Caulfield is a teenage boy expelled from several prep schools, wandering through New York City as he struggles to come to terms with the complexities of growing up. This is the one liner summary of the whole book, but what makes it interesting is the foundation of Holden's character. The Catcher in the Rye takes the loss of innocence as its primary concern. Holden wants to be the “catcher in the rye”—someone who saves children from falling off a cliff, which can be understood as a metaphor for entering adulthood.

## What Holden Wants

He is like everyone, like us during our childhood to teenage years. He has a deep desire to grow up but is not yet ready to face the complexities and duties which come together. He desperately wants to be older in many ways, but his escapist personality makes him believe that running away will solve his problems. So instead of facing his problems, he prefers to run.

But tragically, running does not fix his problems nor anyone’s problems. Throughout the story we see Holden encounters different mindset people with different lifestyles, but everytime he talks with someone, He always expects to see the inner innocence of them.

## Holden’s Personality

Innocence is what he expects in others but He has an angsty, angry personality. He derides most other people as "phonies",

“Holden expands his definition of phony to include anyone who is not 100% genuine at all times or that he doesn't like. People become Phonies when they are hypocritical, shallow, inauthentic, or fake.”

Even Though he hates people and calls them phonies, he still craves closeness with others, He fears that one day he might become a phony himself. However, Holden is also sensitive and caring. His love for his little sister and his tendency to ask a simple question "where the birds in the Central Park pond go during winter" to start a conversation Shows how much he wants to connect with people in a genuine way. It reflects his appreciation for innocence and life as a whole.

## Realization at the end

Holden concludes that there is no way to escape the ugliness of the world. Death is never far from his thoughts, and he imagines that someone probably will put the phrase on his tombstone, right under his name and the dates of his birth and death. In the end Holden gives a great example of courage by showing the importance of listening to yourself and taking a break when you need one.

Catcher in the Rye is one of the books that gave me an in depth analysis of loneliness, Solitude and alienation. Holden Caulfield is the person more human than we ever were, A random book character that really taught me to cherish the people around me because one day you may lose them but not the memories of cherishment.

	Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now. Happily,
	some of them kept records of their troubles. You’ll learn from them—if you want to. Just as
	someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. It’s a beautiful
	reciprocal arrangement. And it isn’t education. It’s history. It’s poetry.
