As we advance in technology every day, it is evident that our attention spans have significantly decreased. Modern innovations designed for entertainment, such as mini videos lasting 15 seconds to 1 minute, which have drastically impacted our ability to focus on any topic for an extended period of time. It has become increasingly difficult to maintain attention on anything beyond a minute.

In this era, our ability to focus on reading articles has also sharply declined. Many of us now rely heavily on AI to summarize information about anything, leading to the rise of AI generative search to next phases. Our brains quickly get tired when listening to someone speak for more than 20 minutes, and similarly reading lengthy articles or conducting research often requires external assistance.

In today’s fast paced world, people prefer sharp, straight to the point content. And for this Generative AI fulfills this need seamlessly by providing quick and efficient assistance.

## Types of AI Generative Search

There are two primary types of AI-powered search engines:
One is Conversational AI and another one is AI Overviews.

### 1. Perplexity Ai

Perplexity AI is a popular Conversational AI search engine that provides summarized versions of topics you search for.

When you enter a query, it displays a textbox below the generated answer, allowing you to ask follow-up questions. This Follow-up feature is what makes it a conversational Ai search approach. It is its ability to retain context, enabling users to seamlessly ask further questions on the same topic without needing to repeat the details of their initial query by eliminating extra steps and ensures a smoother user experience.

### 2. Google’s Ai Overviews

Google’s AI Overviews is a search feature that provides AI generated summaries of topics at the top of search results. Powered by its Gemini language model, this feature has the potential to revolutionize how billions of people search the internet in a more easy and convenient manner.

While on one hand it is convenient for users who no longer need to traverse across multiple websites to gather information on any topics, but it raises concerns about the impact on ad revenue for site owners. Reduced traffic to websites could lead to a significant collapse in the ecosystem of search results.

Google’s AI Overviews are still in the experimental stage and lack some of the features offered by Perplexity, such as storage and answering follow-up queries on the same topic. However, it remains a useful feature for quickly accessing information on less critical not so important topics without having to read lengthy articles.

### 3. Bing AI (ChatGPT-Powered Bing)

Microsoft has integrated Open AI’s GPT models into the Bing search engine, offering results in a much summarized and interactive manner. It was much promoted alongside the Windows and Microsoft products.

Bing AI focuses on creating an interactive and personalized user experience through conversational engagement, standing out from Google AI Overviews, which focus on providing quick summaries of information from various sources. It has a conversational approach.

### 4.YOU.com

The YouChat is Smart Assistant is designed to provide conversational assistance across a wide range of topics, engaging users in dialogue and offering detailed responses.

It excels in logic where ChatGPT fails at. It even supports coding-related queries, making it a much similar to perplexity ai but with different scope in point.

## Conclusion & Summary

As technology continues to shape our habits, Generative AI search tools are becoming integral to how we consume information. Each platform caters to different user needs:

1. Perplexity AI focuses on concise answers with citations.

2. Google AI Overviews provides quick, summarized information.

3. Bing AI emphasizes conversational interactions.

4. You.com prioritizes personalized, ad-free engagement and coding support.

These tools are generating billions of searches daily with tens of millions of daily active users.

While they make accessing information faster and more efficient, the implications for the broader internet ecosystem, particularly for website traffic and ad revenue, remain to be seen. Nonetheless, AI-driven assistance is redefining the way we interact with information in this digital age and it tends to grow in a wide range in upcoming years as the aggregator and summarize is the new way.
