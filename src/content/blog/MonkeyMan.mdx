This movie is what Indian cinema should've been, that's the one thing that was going on my mind throughout the entire movie. Yeah, that's an exaggerating comment but you should see that in India not all movies talk about the stuff happening in india.While many Indian movies may tend to focus on the same routine or escapist stories, this movie offers a portrayal of India that is unapologetically honest and unvarnished everything that's wrong about India. Without buttering up, the monkey man just slams everything on the face. Making it a more unique representation of truth, but unfortunately it remains unreleased in India, proving the point where certain narratives may face challenges in reaching audiences due to their confrontational nature.

Leave the main storyline alone such as revenge and violence stuff, but the substories and topics which they revolve got to be what everything is wrong with India and those topics which are not talked about the most in Indian cinema as lot of the time it often delves into themes of revenge and violence, there's a no significant focus on the deeper societal issues that plague the country. In the order of spreading hate towards different gender we often fail to recognize that we ourselves are experiencing hate as well. What discrimination we face as one community to another mirrors the same dynamic present in gender discrimination too. And we fail to overlook the potential impact of how it could affect them.

But without going much deep into political problems Dev Patel really pulled a smooth revenge story highlighting the pervasive issues of corrupt police such as portrayal of ACAB, Fascist government in Indian society, hate among transgenders all while incorporating a lot of thrilling fight sequences. All these make the movie very much thought provoking and at the same time leaving us with an engaging viewing experience.

What makes monkey man more unique among other action films is not just the movie is so much dependable on actions but rather giving a valid reason to why the protagonist should fight, which is the place more action films fail to implement the meaningful motivation. All the while it gets slow for a bit at one point but that’s what helps to gain deeper insights into the hero’s psyche and the underlying reasons driving his actions.

And finally all these slow pacing and meticulous world-building hyped up to the last 30 minutes, which is the best part of the movie when the narrative thread converges and tension arises, the film took a different mode and delving deep into action mode and it is really the best cinematic experience anyone can get.

Before wrapping this up I have to give a great shout out to a sleek neon cinematography and carefully curated songs to power up the scenes. All these threads connected results in a film that feels polished and expertly crafted from start to finish. It's a testament to Dev’s talent and vision as a filmmaker, and a promising sign of great things to come in his directing career.
