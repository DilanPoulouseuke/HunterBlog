When people follow their own ideals and beliefs, They often feel superior and may justify whatever unjustifiable actions they do. This can lead to what we commonly known as war. We are no new to the war as it has been happening for centuries, and throughout history it is often driven by the superiority complex.

War has many faces as cold war, colonial war, religious war, civil war. But it’s no joke, war is war. People are killed, families are lost, homes are destroyed and the grief goes on from a different perspective which endures in countless ways. Which leaves many feeling hopeless, without the strength to stand up, but rather forced to endure all the pain, And all this injustice is told through the eyes of 4 journalists is all this movie is about.

This civil war is no confederacy of america as I thought it should be when I heard this is about the american Civil War. This is no history but rather a dystopian fictional depiction of the near future with caution for the conclusion of America's current trajectory.

Movie is good, but has many plot holes with poorly written story which leads to nowhere but explores different sufferings. Journalism is a powerful media and director Alex Garland took it to tell a story about dystopian civil warfare, fails in a lot of phases but as a concept which it built upon is very much notable. To make sure that journalists are no fighters but rather an informer to the whole world, This movie captured the pain and hopelessness of those journalists in the field.

It’s quite fascinating how this unique narrative allows the audience to make their own choices, leaving the viewer with a lot of questions in more of a neutral way of storytelling without taking the sides of who is correct or who is wrong. I am much more into raising the question of "What did the president do which made Texas and California join forces?”.

This movie didn’t just start off as a normal movie and took phases through the tension but the atmosphere it got started is kept till the last anticlimactic shot, Filled with a lot of terrifying and some happy scenes with one part even taking on the feel of a road trip drama.

The cinematography and dialogues are some of the hard hitting take away from this film but rather than that for an average viewer this movie has nothing to offer than just some war photography, with a lot of bizarre scenes. It’s no closer than the other famous war drama films but it was enjoyable and has a unique taste to it.
