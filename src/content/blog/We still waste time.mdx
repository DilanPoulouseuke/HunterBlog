By reading this you may think I’m doing something productive and don't procrastinate that I figured something out in life but I would have to say that I'm the same as you are. I finished watching the challengers during that time when I should focus on writing the base paper for my final year project, But Yeah I’m procrastinating by watching movies but I don’t worry I wasted time.

To start with, as everyone you know says during your 20s is the best time to hone your life so that you can live your life, this has been passed down for generations. And Let’s see how this came to be.

We should start with our grandparents' generation. Because that’s where the real expectations really came to be. They had a really hard life since the beginning of their life and to mention the great depression period of war and the economic downsides, They started to work even before finishing the primary school, some didn’t even attend the school. They really worked hard as when they became 20 already married and bought a house with the garden attached. Plumbing, carpenting, electrical work tell one thing and they do it without anyone's help. Because in their mind more hard work gives a fruitful result.

Now this is the generation raised our parent’s generation passing down the mantle of expectations. In their generation the economy took a slight direction as a fraction required studies and some didn't. So these grandparents' generation made them study their eyes off for perfection. Hard work gives good results and great living. Which our parents suffered in this pool of expectations.

Our generation is also raised by expectations too, but not rather the same economy our parents and grandparents raised. Now the economy requires education in all sectors, not just education but hard work and experience. But not only our generation raised on expectation but distraction too. We were raised during the revolution of tech and addiction came along the way, just that scrolling got introduced. It’s hard to live without the distraction but can do something about it.

I call it scrolling depression. Every single thing has become scrolling and we expect the best in every scroll we make and when we get the best we still search for the best of best just like when we go for cloth shopping, This is called scrolling depression. We think we’re in a place of losers where these people in insta posting they figured something out, so we compare and let down ourselves and won’t do a productive or procrastinate such as watching a movie but just worry for the problems we haven’t faced. Eventually we still waste time by worrying we wasted time.

So before comparing yourself to others I should say look through everyone, because You wouldn’t worry so much what people think about you, if you realized how little they do. So instead of just depressing yourself with the anxiety you are never going to face just do it.

Long ago I read this quote
“We are not afraid of our failures but other people’s reactions towards our failures.”

But you should come to the point that no one cares, Everyone has their own problems. They are looking at you because they have problems too, we all do. We forget who we are and our own problems when we look at someone else's life. That's the main reason movies came into existence as the sole purpose of escaping reality. Putting our views on the protagonist.

It’s never too late to start anything, as the benjamin button said “There are no rules to this game start whenever you want”, as 20s expectations came to be passed down to us but can be achieved when we reduce expectations and perceive reality as it is, then work on yourself as taking a baby steps without comparing you with a professional in the same field and depressing yourself with the work you didn’t put to achieve what he achieved.

Which follows through Just like Bruce lee said:

Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water.
Flow like a water, do not think a single thought twice just do it, So next time when you watch a movie thinking you are wasting time, try to remind yourself of the reality that you are not gonna do anything in these 2 hours that you haven’t done in your whole life.

While the 20s expectations which passed down by our forefathers doesn’t apply to the society we live in but still we got to do it anyway either hard work or smartwork, but you have to believe there is no timeframe for it, So don’t worry about wasting time because you sure will waste time anyway so whether it is watching a movie or scrolling through reels or tik tok for hours in your day or whatever hobbies you think it’ll eat up your time. Just do it because eventually one day you’ll figure out for sure because Hey, We got one life.
