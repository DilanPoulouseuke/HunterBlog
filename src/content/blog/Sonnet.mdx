Everyone is only aware of ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini but many leave Claude out of the options, but it is similar to all other text AI. Claude was developed by Anthropic, a U.S.-based artificial intelligence startup public-benefit company, back in 2021. Now this Anthropic’s new version of Claude solves the prompt in 2x speed of intelligence, exceeds the opus version twice.

## What’s New?

1.  For one part it’s faster in all the work it has done before with higher accuracy. It shows marked improvement in grasping nuance, humor, and complex instructions, and is exceptional at writing high-quality content with a natural, relatable tone.

2.  Artifacts, a new way to use Claude. When a user asks Claude to generate content like code snippets, text documents, or website designs, these Artifacts appear in a dedicated window alongside their conversation. This creates a dynamic workspace where they can see, edit, and build upon Claude’s creations in real-time, seamlessly integrating AI-generated content into their projects and workflows.

3.  State-of-the-art vision, This new model art vision improvements are most noticeable for tasks that require visual reasoning, like interpreting charts and graphs. Claude 3.5 Sonnet can also accurately transcribe text from imperfect images—a core capability for retail, logistics, and financial services, where AI may glean more insights from an image, graphic or illustration than from text alone.

As of right now the only drawback Claude has is no Android application, they are working on this, as currently there is only an iOS app. Since this new family of 3.5 versions started with sonnet, there is still a bigger fish Opus still hasn't released, but right now a middle version of Claude had the possibility to kick GPT-4o and Gemini. It's exciting to consider what Claude 3.5 Opus might be capable of when it is released.
