Google came up with the new release one day right after the OpenAi unveiled GPT-4o, This time it’s a new project called Google Astra. From the demonstration at the event it is said that Astra is the new future of Google.

## So What is Project Astra?

Astra is the one to replace all the personal assistants we’ve been using till now to become the one of universal assistants. It is a real-time, multimodal AI assistant that can see the world, knows what things are and where you left them, and can answer questions or help you do almost anything.

In an incredibly impressive demo video that Hassabis swears is not faked or doctored in any way, an Astra user in Google’s London office did a domo by asking the system to identify a part of a speaker, find their missing glasses, review code, and more. It all works practically in real time and in a very conversational way.

In one demo the user pointed the camera out and asked the question about “What neighborhood do you
think I’m in?” and the Ai system is able to identify and answer that question with the right
address.

People will be able to use Astra through their smartphones and possibly desktop computers, but the company is exploring other options too, such as embedding it into smart glasses or other devices, Oriol Vinyals.

And for it does not stop right there as Google unveiled not only Astra, but rather multiple releases such as new features done with Gemini and project Veo (Generate video from text prompt).

## Opinion

Tech companies are in the competition to become the best in Artificial Intelligence, to take the title of AI supremacy. But so to say It’s quite impressive that all this could even be possible, over the course of understanding, training and developing throughout the years it came down to this and it won’t stop right there but expands much more to in future.

It is amazing that google is growing in a developing phase not only in the backend fast pacing model itself but in front of user experience too. We all know it takes a large amount of resources to make it work so seamlessly. But Google and OpenAi are pulling strings with the help of Search results and large data collection from billions of users to make this work. It is not possible without data collection, that’s the one thing small Ai companies thrive to do so.

Looking at this I remember Nathan from the movie Ex Machina, Where he develops Ava, a superficial humanoid Ai agent with the data from billions of users. On watching the demonstration today I remember that movie of how this is possible and thought about the evolution we need.
