In this world of wasteland, solitude is never the answer but a tragedy, a tragedy which needs to be undergone different phases until death. Geroge Miller really has proven once again that he is and will continue to be the one and only visionary capable to structure this mad max universe.

We have been stuffed with various sequels and prequels when a movie became so successful, at times most of them will be bad compared to the first one. Some outpace the originals too, in that place Furiosa not only demonstrated the wide spectrum of the Mad Max universe but stands at the top along with Mad Max: Fury Road.

Ten years in the making, This movie does not follow the voyage of Max Rockatansky but rather the life of Furiosa who is one of the characters from Max’s odyssey through the wasteland. Compared to the originals this movie explores a wide range of mechanisms with much more imagery of how this crazy world operates.

It’s really impressive that the world building of wasteland was much more stunning and immersive than the fury road. We got so much information about wasteland and their rulers in different regions. Each is designed with a greater perspective by Miller, as each one of character, place, weapons and more importantly the vehicle they use are detailed much more with significant time and care, it all can be vividly visualized right in our experience.

The idea gives real meaning to vision and vision gives meaning to elemental building. George Miller's elemental building of Mad Max did not come from a minimal point of view, it’s an experiment in considering to What extent people would go for their vehicle and its design? Which gave the rise to Mad Max we know of. Vehicles have been designed with exceptional care especially the Bikes and their engines with the sound design it’s all perfect. A lot of scenes defined the elements of fury road and how it came to existence.

There is nothing particular to single out as better than this or this is the best in this movie as everything right from World-building to character arcs or movie mechanisms like story, screenplay, dialogues with much more depth and humor, cinematography, vibrance, sound design, even the acting, Everything was crafted at its best form. This is clearly one of the best movies I've ever experienced in cinemas. I could feel the engine roaring behind my legs in the theater whenever someone started their bike.

Everything was at its peak and it would be underappreciation if we don’t talk about the characters and their actor’s performance. As we know Anya and her role as Furiosa whose legacy was built by Charlize Theron. Although she had fewer dialogues in this movie, her screen presence is filled with female rage, which pretty much gave the depth to the charlize theron’s portrayal of Furiosa. Chris Hemsworth’s Dr.Dementus, a bike warlord in the wasteland is much more of energetic ruthless villain with a comedic nature. At times his actions are filled with terrifying, yet they are also represented with a touch of comedy.

Movie is immersive, but it felt a little too long and so much longer chasing scenes compared to Fury Road. Despite the movie's runtime, the two and half hour movie felt like I was watching it for three hours. This feeling of extended duration gives the audience a full Movie experience without wanting more of it anytime soon.

It’s pretty great the sequel which was already in the works for mad max said to be released soon as it won’t take too much time like the prequels. There is no information about the release but it will be more like the wait time shouldn’t be like the titles already released.
